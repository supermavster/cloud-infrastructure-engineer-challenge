# Decisions

The choices that shaped this repository, what was rejected, and what each one
costs. Each is a trade-off, so each says when to revisit it.

## 1. Terraform

**Chosen.** Terraform, with the AWS provider pinned to 6.x and Terraform itself to
1.11 or newer (below 2.0).

**Rejected.** AWS CDK, CloudFormation and SAM tie the work to AWS and make the
change set harder to review than a plan. Pulumi has a smaller ecosystem of
checks. OpenTofu would probably work unchanged but was not tested.

**Why.** The challenge prefers Terraform. The plan is a reviewable diff, the AWS
provider is mature, `terraform test` can mock AWS so the configuration is tested
without an account, and tflint, checkov and terraform-docs are built around it.

**Costs.** State has to be managed (see 9), and the 1.11 minimum excludes older
installations.

## 2. One root module, settings outside the code

**Chosen.** `terraform/` is a thin root that wires modules together.
Per-environment values live in `environments/<env>/terraform.tfvars`, and the
state location is passed at `init` (the bucket, and a key per environment and
region). Variables that differ per environment have no default.

**Rejected.** Terragrunt, and separate stacks that read each other's state. Both
add ordering and coupling that a single environment does not need, and a reviewer
would have to run several applies.

**Why.** One `init` and one `apply`, and the same code deploys to any account.

**Revisit** when there are several teams or accounts and a stack's blast radius
needs to be smaller.

## 3. Own modules from plain resources

**Chosen.** Seven small modules written against the AWS provider directly.

**Rejected.** The community `terraform-aws-modules`. They are well maintained,
but networking and IAM are what this challenge evaluates, so they should be
visible in the code, and there is no third-party code to review or pin.

**Costs.** More code to maintain. Switching later is a contained change, because
each module has a narrow interface.

## 4. RDS PostgreSQL

**Chosen.** RDS PostgreSQL 17.

**Rejected.** A database or application on EC2.

**Why.** AWS handles backups, point-in-time restore, Multi-AZ failover, patching
and storage encryption. EC2 would mean owning all of that, plus SSH access and
operating-system patching, for no benefit here. It also covers two of the
optional items (high availability and backups).

## 5. HTTP API, not REST API

**Chosen.** API Gateway HTTP API.

**Rejected.** REST API.

**Why.** It is cheaper and simpler, and the REST-only features (AWS WAF, API
keys, usage plans, X-Ray) are not needed for one public route.

**Costs.** No WAF without CloudFront in front. Revisit if the endpoint needs
per-client limits or WAF.

## 6. Database password managed by RDS

**Chosen.** `manage_master_user_password`: RDS creates the password, stores it in
Secrets Manager under the data key, and rotates it every seven days. The Lambda
reads it at run time and re-reads it after an authentication failure.

**Rejected.** A `random_password` resource, whose value ends up in Terraform
state. A write-only password argument keeps it out of state but leaves rotation
to us. IAM database authentication for the master user would need a database
user created first.

**Why.** No password in code, variables or state, and rotation is automatic.

**Revisit** to give the function its own read-only database user with IAM
authentication, which would narrow what a stolen credential can do.

## 7. Verified TLS

**Chosen.** `rds.force_ssl = 1` on the server, and the Lambda verifies the
certificate chain and hostname against the bundled RDS certificate authority
bundle.

**Rejected.** Encrypting without checking the certificate, which stops
eavesdropping but not impersonation.

**Costs.** The bundle is a 170 KB file in the repository; the README next to it
says where it came from and how to refresh it. The behaviour against a real RDS
certificate is only provable once deployed.

## 8. NAT layout is a setting

**Chosen.** `nat_gateway_mode`: `single` (one shared gateway, dev) or `per_az`
(one per zone, prod).

**Rejected.** Always one per zone: it doubles the largest fixed cost of the dev
profile for availability nobody needs there.

**Costs.** In `single` mode the zone holding the gateway is a single point of
failure for outbound access.

## 9. Deletion protection, not `prevent_destroy`

**Chosen.** The database uses `deletion_protection`, a final snapshot with a
unique name, and both are settings.

**Rejected.** `prevent_destroy`, because a lifecycle argument cannot be set from
a variable, so nobody could tear down a throwaway environment.

**Exception.** The state bucket uses `prevent_destroy`: losing it orphans every
environment, and it is not meant to be destroyed with them.

## 10. S3 native state locking

**Chosen.** The S3 backend with `use_lockfile`, available from Terraform 1.11.

**Rejected.** A DynamoDB lock table, whose arguments are deprecated in favour of
this. One fewer resource to create and pay for.

## 11. Cap the connections instead of adding RDS Proxy

**Chosen.** An API throttle and a Lambda concurrency cap bound the database
connections. The arithmetic is in [architecture.md](architecture.md#capacity-and-timeouts).

**Rejected.** RDS Proxy. It is the right answer at higher scale, but it adds a
resource that bills by the hour and one more thing to secure, and the cap already
keeps connections well under the limit here.

**Revisit** when the request rate, or the number of functions sharing the
database, grows.

## 12. Checks run through pinned tools

**Chosen.** checkov and actionlint run through `uvx` at exact versions, and CI
calls the same Makefile targets a developer does.

**Why.** The checkov package installed on the author's workstation had a broken
wrapper, and a bare command would also have made results depend on whatever was
installed. Pinning removes both problems and keeps local and CI results the same.
